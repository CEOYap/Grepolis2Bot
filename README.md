The is the source code from the Grepolis 2 Bot project on http://bots.uthar.nl.
It started as a small hobby project back in 2011, and has currently grown in a full featured bot. Now that the development has come to an end I decided to make the source code public. Feel free to fork this project to continue with your own version of the bot.
